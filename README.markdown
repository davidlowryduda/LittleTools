# Little Tools

The little tools that I make to make my work just a little bit easier,
collected together. I briefly describe each tool here.


## Caution ##

I use these tools in *practical* ways, but no necessarily *safe* ways. These
tools should only be used for trusted inputs and by trusted users.
