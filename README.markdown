# Little Tools

The little tools that I make to make my work just a little bit easier,
collected together. I briefly describe each tool here.


# The Tools #

## python_rec_server ##

Python's `http.server` is great for serving (sending) files locally. But
sometimes it's nice to receive files too, e.g. over LAN. This is what
`python_rec_server` does.

It is **insecure**. But I use it all the time, especially to transfer things
to or from annoying devices like a tablet.


## combine_lecture_notes ##

Sometimes I want to read through a set of notes that are posted as per-class
PDFs. But I want them like a book. Combining them is easy, but this makes it
easier.


## Caution ##

I use these tools in *practical* ways, but no necessarily *safe* ways. These
tools should only be used for trusted inputs and by trusted users.


## Licensing

Unless stated differently, every tool here is available under the GPL3+.

Contact me for licensing questions.
