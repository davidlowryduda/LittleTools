"""
This is a simple HTTP server that has standard GET and POST requests
implemented, so it can also receive files. A tiny utility file
request page is also implemented to facilitate adding files. (Though curl also
works).

Usage:
    Call `python3 python_rec_server.py`

Then an UNSECURE http server is running from the local directory. Access that
port via a server to easily transfer files.
